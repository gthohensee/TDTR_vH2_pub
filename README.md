TDTR_vH2_pub
============

This is a standalone package of MATLAB scripts for efficient and powerful TDTR* data analysis.

A version of this package can be found at David Cahill's website 
(http://users.mrl.illinois.edu/cahill/tcdata/tcdata.html). 

I developed this package from the MATLAB scripts written by 
Joseph P. Feser, which are also available from Prof. Cahill's website.
