TDTR_vH2_pub
============

This is a standalone package of MATLAB scripts for efficient and powerful TDTR* data analysis.

A version should soon be online at David Cahill's website (http://users.mrl.illinois.edu/cahill/tcdata/tcdata.html) as well. I developed this package from the MATLAB scripts written by Joseph P. Feser, which are also available from Prof. Cahill's website.

*: Time-domain thermoreflectance, a pump-probe optical technique for characterizing nanoscale heat transport. See relevant publications, e.g.

David Cahill, "Analysis of heat flow in layered structures for time-domain thermoreflectance", Rev. Sci. Instrum. 75, 5119 (2004)
